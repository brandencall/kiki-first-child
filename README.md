# Introduction

## Game summary
This will be a roguelike game with skill trees that players build overtime to get stronger. The main game loop will
envolve players fighting enemies, collecting xp and getting/upgrading abilities.


## Inspiration
### Vampire Survivor
It will consist of a similar game play loop where the player will fight enemies and upgrade their abilities overtime.
Enemies get stronger the longer the player survives.

### Death must die
It will consist of a similar skill tree system where players can upgrade their skill trees overtime. The skill tree
upgrades are persistent through out the life time of the game and don't go away after a single run.

## Player Experience
Players will fight enemies in pre-designed arena-style maps. The longer the player survives the harder it becomes. 
Enemy spawning and ability aquiring/upgrading will be randomized. Abilities, skill trees and weapon types will have 
synergies. Overtime players get stronger as their skill tree increases.

## Platform
The game will be developed for windows PC.

## Development Software
- Godot 4.4.1
- Aseprite for graphics

## Genre
Singleplayer, roguelike

# Concept

## Gameplayer Overview
The player will spawn in an arena with their chosen character. They will move around the map trying to dodge and kill enemies.
Some characters will be auto attack and some will be manual attack characters. After killing an enemy there is a chance that
it drops xp. This xp is used to aquire abilities. Ability choices are randomized and the player can only hold a limited
amount of abilities. Some abilities are passive and some are manual. 

Will there be bosses? Will players be able to increase difficulty on their own for better items (Death must die)?

# Art

## Theme
Themed around all the boys being the playable characters with their skill trees being based on their personalities and 
characteristics.

Will it be a similar art style/ theme as Death must die? Dungeon styled?

## Design
I think the art style should be minimal with it being in pixel art.

# Audio

## Music
Maybe we could Hodge to do some of the background music for us. I can even ask Christian to see if he would be down.
Probably want different ones for main menu and game play. Could even have more intense music for later on in the level or
during boss fights (if we have boss fights).

## Sound Effects
Should have sound effects for almost anything. The different abilities will have different sounds. Collecting xp should
have a sound. Selecting an ability should have a sound.

# Game Experience

## UI
Minimal UI so that we can focus on gameplay.

## Controls
### Keyboard
- WASD
- Mouse (for selecting abilities)
- Other buttons for activating an ability??
